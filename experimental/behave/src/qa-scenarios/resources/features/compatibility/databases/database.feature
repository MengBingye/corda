Feature: Compatibility - Database providers
  To support an interoperable Corda network, a Corda (OS) node must have the ability to transact with an R3 Corda (Enterprise) node using different database providers.

  Scenario Outline: QA: Corda (OS) Node using H2 can transact with R3 Corda (Enterprise) node using SQL Server, in an R3 Corda configured network.
    Given a node PartyA of version <R3-Corda-Node-Version> with proxy
    And node PartyA uses database of type <Database-Type>
    And node PartyA has the finance app installed
    And a node PartyB of version <Corda-Node-Version>
    And node PartyB has the finance app installed
    And a nonvalidating notary Notary of version <R3-Corda-Node-Version>
    When the network is ready
    Then node PartyA can issue 1000 <Currency>
    And node PartyA can transfer 100 <Currency> to node PartyB

    Examples:
      | Corda-Node-Version | R3-Corda-Node-Version   | Currency | Database-Type     |
#      | corda-3.0          | r3-master               | GBP      | SQL Server        |
      | corda-3.0          | r3corda-3.0-DP3-RC04        | GBP      | SQL Server    |

  Scenario Outline: QA: Corda (OS) Node using H2 can transact with R3 Corda (Enterprise) node using Postgres, in an R3 Corda configured network.
    Given a node PartyA of version <R3-Corda-Node-Version> with proxy
    And node PartyA uses database of type <Database-Type>
    And node PartyA has the finance app installed
    And a node PartyB of version <Corda-Node-Version>
    And node PartyB has the finance app installed
    And a nonvalidating notary Notary of version <R3-Corda-Node-Version>
    When the network is ready
    Then node PartyA can issue 1000 <Currency>
    And node PartyA can transfer 100 <Currency> to node PartyB

    Examples:
      | Corda-Node-Version | R3-Corda-Node-Version   | Currency | Database-Type   |
#      | corda-3.0          | r3-master               | GBP      | postgres        |
      | corda-3.0          | r3corda-3.0-DP3-RC04        | GBP      | postgres    |
